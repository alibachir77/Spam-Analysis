# Spam-Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to analyze different English datasets and classify messages from various sources as either spam or ham. One of the key challenges faced in today's digital landscape is the scarcity of multilingual datasets, hindering the application of models on a global scale. To address this, the project will involve translating messages into either French or Arabic, enabling the testing of previously developed models with potential hyper-parameter adjustments.

The tasks to be undertaken in this project include:
1. Conducting a literature review on Spam Filtering and Translation Analysis to gain insights into best practices and methodologies.
2. Translating the given messages into French or Arabic, or potentially both languages if time permits, to facilitate cross-lingual analysis.
3. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), focusing on aspects such as sentence lengths, commonly used stop words, and creating Word Cloud visualizations for both spam and ham messages.
4. Developing three distinct Machine Learning models tailored for the English and French datasets to classify messages accurately. 
5. Adapting and fine-tuning these models for the translated datasets, potentially making adjustments to hyper-parameters to enhance performance.
6. Conducting a comparative analysis of the model performances across different datasets, evaluating their effectiveness in classifying spam and ham messages accurately.

By undertaking these tasks, the project aims to explore the challenges associated with multilingual data analysis, develop robust Machine Learning models for spam classification, and assess the impact of translation on model performance. Through this comprehensive approach, the project seeks to contribute valuable insights to the field of NLP and spam filtering while addressing the complexities of working with multilingual datasets.
